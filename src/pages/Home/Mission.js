        <p className={styles.description}>The Pakistani Student Association (PSA) at UC Berkeley is a student-run organization that aims to foster a sense of community among Pakistani students, promote Pakistani culture, and provide a platform for students to connect with one another and engage in cultural and social activities. Our mission is to create a welcoming and inclusive space for Pakistani students to share their experiences and perspectives, and to raise awareness and appreciation for the diversity and richness of Pakistani culture. Through our events, we hope to promote cross-cultural understanding and dialogue and to build bridges of friendship and understanding between the Pakistani community and other communities on campus. We believe that by fostering a sense of community and promoting cultural awareness, we can help create a more vibrant and inclusive campus culture that celebrates diversity and encourages dialogue and mutual respect.</p>
